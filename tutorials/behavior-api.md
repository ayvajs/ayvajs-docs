> This tutorial assumes that you have completed other tutorials and at least have some familiarity with Ayva's  <a href="./tutorial-motion-api.html" target="_blank">Motion API</a>.

> Examples in this tutorial will make use of the <a href="https://github.com/ayvajs/osr-emu" target="_blank">OSR Emulator</a> embedded in editable codepens. That way, you can run them without an actual device! <br><br>_Note: Examples tend to omit boilerplate code such as importing Ayva, setting up the emulator, or setting axis limits. These are however still present in the actual codepens themselves._
